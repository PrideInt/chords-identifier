# Chords Identifier

## Overview

This program takes in a key (written in notation in which uppercase represents **major** scale, lowercase represents **minor** scale)
and outputs a series of chords that exist within that scale.

## Input

Input your key as so with the following standard notations (note followed by sign (sharp - #; flat - b), in major, capitalize the note; in minor, lowercase the note)

### Major

Say we want to input G major:

```c++
Enter a key: G
```

Say we want to input F# major:

```c++
Enter a key: F#
```

### Minor

Say we want to input B flat minor:

```c++
Enter a key: bb
```

Say we want to input C sharp minor:

```c++
Enter a key: c#
```
